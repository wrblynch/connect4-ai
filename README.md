# Connect-4 Supervised Machine Learning Models vs Minimax Search
---
Our goal is to figure out if certain machine learning algorithms are able to beat the popular minimax search algorithm in a game of connect 4. We want the algortihms to determine whether or not given any board state in a game without a guaranteed loss in the next move, a "checkmate", can result in a victory for the player. Our data contains all possible board states where either player has not won yet, as well as whether or not that board state is a win for a particular player. It is measured by having a variable for every single spot in a connect four board, and which piece is in that spot. Other variables include the two players, the board, the number of turns required to win, and the winrate. We created a decision tree and a support vector machine model along with a minimax search algorithm. We then created a simulation to have minimax and our models play against each other and recorded the winrate of both models and the minimax algorithm. Our results indicated that given our dataset and our methodologies to implementing models, classifiers cannot outperform minimax.
